    <p class="introduce">I'm an electrical engineer working as a maintenance engineer.
        I realized that I'm interested in tech. So I've
        started to learn about web development by myself for about 4 months.
        Recently I found a course called
        "devcamp" on Facebook. I decided to apply the course.</p>
